# fingerboss

Webserver for the fingerboss game

# Principals
- there should be no need for any text in the game
- there is only one button to press in the entire game - when the game is over
- there is no build in chance, the game is designed to be as equal as possible, it's only about skill not luck

# Ideas

## Joining
- 1 player wait for another to join
- 2 players, just start the game
- late to the game, start with points of lowest score

## Playing
- icons are in your color, so its clear what color you are
- start with "touch" icon
- Spin (minimum time to create a circle) then make circle larger by holding down
- Velocity of growing circle higher at the bottom
- You can move your finger while touching, up smaller circle, down bigger circle
- Circle move upward
- When you collide with another players circle, they cancle each other out (antimatter) a circle of Volume 40 can kill two circles of volume 10 aznd becomes volume 20.
- The scores are displayed at the top, in a top bar where you can not create circles.
- When a circle, of any size, survives to the top of the screen a player gets a point

## Winning
- Some score (to be decided) decides the winner

# so far discarded ideas
## playing
- pulse size - let go at the right time (irregular) (introduces more chance in the game)
- velocity of growing circle lower when more players? Maybe not needed.
- Circle needs approval by server (later)
