# About
This is my first game ever. I made it because I teach kids programming as a volunteer at 
[coding pirates](http://codingpirates.dk/).
The kids really want to make games, it's a great way to learn programming. So I made this game to try it myself, so
I can be better at teaching them.

# Principals of the game
- There should be no need for any text in the game (Damn I have added some help)
- There is only one continue "button" to press in the entire game - when the game is over
- There is no build in chance, the game is designed to be as equal as possible, it's only about skill not luck
- The game can resize to any screen size and any phone orientation
