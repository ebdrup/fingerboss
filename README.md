# About
This is my second game ever. I made it because I teach kids programming as a volunteer at
[coding pirates](http://codingpirates.dk/).
The kids really want to make games, it's a great way to learn programming. So I made this game to try it myself, so
I can be better at teaching them.

# Principals of the game
- There should be no need for any text in the game (Damn I have added some help)
- There is very little build in chance, the game is designed to be as equal as possible, it's about skill not luck
- The game can resize to any screen size and any phone orientation

# The game

## Joining
- 1 player play against the computer
- 2+ players, play against each other and the computer
- No matter what, the game just starts as soon as it's loaded

## Ideas
- A ball and two goals
- Collide with the ball to pick it up
- Click to shoot the ball
- If you hit another snake when you have the ball you die, and respawn
- A map in the corner of the playing field
- Eat things to get bigger/smaller/split


## Winning
- When time is up, the team with the most goals wins.
